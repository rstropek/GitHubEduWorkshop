# JavaScript Exercise

> Note that this starter code is part of the workshop [*GitHub for Computer Science classes*](GitHub for Computer Science classes).

## Introduction

In this exercise, you have to show that you master the fundamentals of JavaScript programming.

## Exercise

[*math.js*](math.js) is a JavaScript module exporting three mathematical functions. However, they are only declared, not implemented. Your job is to add the necessary implementations.

## Test

You can verify whether your code is correct by running the unit tests ([*math.spec.js*](math.spec.js)). This is how you do that:

* Make sure that [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is installed on your computer
* Clone your assignment repository: `git clone ...`
* Open a shell (e.g. command prompt, bash) and navigate to the directory containing the cloned repository
* Install necessary Node.js package: `npm install`
* Run unit tests: `npm test`

If your code contains errors, fix them and rerun the last step as long as there are failing unit tests.
